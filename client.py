"""The Jev client: pluggable decision endpoints with total failure containment.

Every method returns a :class:`Decision` or ``None``. It never raises: a timeout, a 500, a
402, a malformed body, an unknown choice or a low-confidence answer all end as ``None`` plus
a reason string, so the caller's request goes out byte-identical to a plugin-disabled run.
