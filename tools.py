"""Agent-facing tools: ask the router what it sees and what it would do.

The host's tool registry invokes a registered handler as ``handler(args, **context)`` — the
model's arguments arrive as ONE dict in the first positional slot and the per-call context
(``task_id``, ``session_id``, ...) as signature-inspected keyword arguments. A handler shaped
``handler(recent: int = 5, **_)`` therefore binds the arguments dict to ``recent`` and raises
``TypeError: int() argument must be ... not 'dict'`` on every parameterised call, while the
no-argument form (``{}``, or kwargs only) silently works — which is how the bug hid. Every
handler below takes ``args`` first.
